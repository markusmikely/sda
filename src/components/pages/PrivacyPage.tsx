                <h2>Recruitment and Criminal Data Processing</h2>
                <p>From time to time we will advertise on our website vacancies which may arise. For the recruitment and selection we will require personal data to determine a pool of suitable applicants. See <a href="https://www.royalacademyofdance.org/media/2019/01/11151754/RecruitmentSelectionPolicy_June2018_3_final.pdf">more information on data processing for recruitment</a>.</p>
                <p>Due to the nature of our organisation, we carry out criminal background checks in instances such as before we offer positions to those who may have to work with children or other vulnerable groups, apply for certain RAD memberships or when you apply to one of our courses. In order to carry out such checks we will engage with a third-party company called <a href="https://www.ddc.uk.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Due Diligence Checking Ltd</a>. We do this to ensure the vital interests of our students and other legal obligations such as safeguarding.</p>
                <p>You can review our <a href="https://media.royalacademyofdance.org/media/2019/12/20141448/Criminal-Record-Checks-and-Recruitment-of-ex-offenders-policy-Dec-2019.pdf">Criminal Records Checks and Recruitment of Ex-Offenders policy.</a></p>
                <p>More information can be found in the separate department privacy policies. If you have any questions or concerns about this you can contact us using our details mentioned above.</p>
                <h2>Children</h2>
                <p>We are particularly concerned to protect the privacy of children. We are confident that our systems and processes are designed to be fair to children, to protect their rights and freedoms, and to be fully in line with their reasonable expectations and those of their parents. We take responsibility for identifying the risks and consequences of processing children’s data. Sometimes we may need to check your age, which might mean we need to contact your parent or guardian.</p>
                <h2>Safeguarding</h2>
                <p>The RAD has a statutory and moral duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children, young people and vulnerable adults receiving education and training with us. More information can be found in our <a href="https://media.royalacademyofdance.org/media/2022/06/30111513/June2022-policy-and-procedures-on-safeguarding.pdf">Safeguarding Policy &amp; Procedures</a>.</p>
                <h2>Who has access to your information and data sharing</h2>
                <p>The RAD does not sell, rent or buy your information to or from other organisations.</p>
                <p>We will not release your information to other organisations unless in exceptional cases when we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.</p>
                <p>Also due to the nature of our organisation departments within RAD may share your data with each other to help fulfil orders, answer queries or help with educational aspects with your time with us to name as a few examples. This may also involve data sharing with other RAD offices across the globe. Where data sharing is required we ensure there is a legitimate purpose to do so and we have consulted with our Data Protection Officer.</p>
                <h2>Transferring your information outside of the UK/EEA</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, due to the nature of our organisation there may be instances where we may need to transfer your data outside the UK. We may need to share your data with other RAD entities or companies who are in the European Economic Area (The EU member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), in an adequate listed country or in other third countries who may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. If we need to transfer your information outside the UK we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Notice.</p>
                <h2>Third-party service providers</h2>
                <p>We make certain personal information available to third parties who provide services to us. We do so on a ‘need to know basis’ and in accordance with data protection legislation. Where we do use third-party service providers we will ensure they have the appropriate data processor/data sharing agreement in place and the agreements contain the appropriate clauses as well.</p>

                <p>We may be required to submit data which includes personal information to one or more of the named organisations in order to comply with their conditions of recognition, maintain the RAD’s status as a recognised awarding body and for quality assurance purposes.</p>
                <p>The RAD also offers GCSE, AS and A Level Dance. In order for students to be entered in for their examination, we are required to share their full name, date of birth, gender and UCI and ULN number with the exam board AQA. This personal is requested by the exam board and no further details are shared. For more information on how your information is used, please see their Privacy Notice.</p>
                <p>In addition in order for students to be approved for access arrangements (special requirements in order to sit exam e.g. extra time), we are required to share their full name, date of birth, gender, UCI and ULN number and evidence of SEND requirements with JCQ.

                <h2>Marketing &amp; Communications</h2>
                <p>The RAD has a marketing department (based in the UK head office) who help carry out promotional activities in order to promote and communicate updates, events and news from the RAD which may be of interest to you. We carry out marketing through various means such as through our websites, online social media channels, emails and hardcopy to name a few examples. Marketing in the RAD may also involve online webinars or in-person events (where permitted) and we will ensure the relevant notice is issued to help provide further information to these webinars/events along with why personal data is needed. We ensure we capture an individual’s consent before contacting them with any marketing campaigns and individuals have the ability to opt out whenever they chose to do so.</p>
                <p>Various departments within the RAD may also ask for your consent to opt in to receive any marketing communications when registering or signing up to them. If you do opt in for receiving any marketing communications they will forward a list of those who have opted into the RAD marketing department who administer the marketing communications. The RAD marketing department will regularly refresh marketing lists in order to ensure those who have opted out are no longer contacted.</p>
                <p>For more information, you can contact us as set out in this privacy notice.</p>
                <h2>Social Media Platforms</h2>
                <p>If you engage with the RAD on any of our social media channels you should know that we do not collect your personal information it remains within the platform that we are using and so you should familiarise yourself with their privacy notices and policies: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube.
