                    <p>Fees cover one full term. Discounts or refunds will not be given for classes missed by the pupil,
                        unless explicitly arranged with the Principal.</p>

                    <p>The School should receive fees by the date shown on the invoice. Any late payments will incur a
                        surcharge of &pound;10 to cover admin costs.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>We offer a 2-week trial session for &pound;15.00, or &pound;20.00 for a double class. If the
                        student decides to join the class, he/she/the parents/carers should complete the Hummingbird
                        registration form, GDPR consent form and pay the registration and one-off insurance fee of
                        &pound;10. An invoice will then be issued for the remaining term fees.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The only method of payment is via online bank transfer / BACS. An email with an invoice will be

                <li>
                    <p>All fees are non-refundable. If a pupil has a long-term illness or injury, fees may be refunded
                        at the Principal&rsquo;s discretion. This does not include minor illness or holidays taken
                        during the term.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Due COVID-19 restrictions, students are temporarily unable to make-up any missed classes. This is
                        essential in our operation to comply with UK government COVID-19 guidelines and maintain
                        &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; for each of our classes. As soon as these restrictions are lifted, we will
                        once again be able to offer up to 2 make-up classes per term &ndash; depending on availability.

                <li>
                    <p>Parents of children under the age of 3 years old must remain on the premises at all times whilst
                        their child is in attendance at Hummingbird School of Dance due to our insurance policy. This
                        still applies during the period of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>&nbsp;On the rare occasion that a class is cancelled, it will be rescheduled, usually during the
                        school holidays. If this is not possible, any fees already paid for the scheduled class will be
                        subtracted from the next term&rsquo;s fees.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>The School will not be held responsible for classes cancelled for circumstances beyond the
                        School&rsquo;s control. If it is necessary to cancel a class due to adverse weather conditions /
                        a force majeure, or if a child cannot attend a class due to their participation in another
                        Hummingbird School of Dance performance/exam/event, class fees will not be refunded.</p>

                        we may be unable to supervise them as the maximum-room capacities do not permit us to have an
                        extra body in the room. Parents understands that if they are late picking their child up, their
                        child will not be supervised and the parent takes full responsibility for their child&rsquo;s
                        safety and wellbeing should anything happen to them after their class time has ended.</p>

                        The teacher will assess whether it is safe and reasonable to ask them to wear a mask and will
                        provide a single-use disposable mask to the dancer. The teacher will then contact the parent to
                        collect their child. Anything that they have touched will be cleaned adequately and parents of
                        all dancers attending that class (or any class where the symptomatic child has danced in) will

                        COVID-19 guidelines, we will not be able to provide this opportunity until COVID-19 advice is
                        revised. Should there be a change in guidance you shall be informed as soon as possible.</p>
